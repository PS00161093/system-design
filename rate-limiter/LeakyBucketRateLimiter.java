/**
 * Thread-safe Leaky Bucket Rate Limiter implementation.
 * <p>
 * The leaky bucket algorithm works by:
 * 1. Maintaining a bucket with current water level (requests)
 * 2. Incoming requests add water to the bucket
 * 3. Water leaks out at a constant rate (leak rate)
 * 4. If bucket overflows (exceeds capacity), requests are rejected
 * 5. The leak rate determines the sustained output rate
 * <p>
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Smooths traffic by maintaining a steady output rate
 * - Rejects requests when bucket is full (no buffering like queuing)
 * - Water level represents accumulated requests waiting to be processed
